However, I did spend some time in Australia, and that was working with fruit bats. All of the bats that were held in captivity were actually bats that have been rescued. It's kind of a place where they would be able to have longer lives, because they wouldn't have survived due to certain disabilities or injuries. So, I think there is a certain good way or certain benefit that we can offer to animals by keeping them in captivity." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
