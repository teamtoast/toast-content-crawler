I had a bit of a culture shock there. In TV shows and in movies, curse words are beep-beeped out and you're never going to see a woman's naked breasts or anything. You're never going to see naked people during daytime television which actually kind of surprised me because on German television that's not a problem. Even curse words are OK. When I came to Japan, I was surprised that there was also a lot of censorship." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
