                      I still have so many years left. The degree that
                      I'm taking, social anthropology, isn't really a
                      degree that you get work from. Especially, only
                      with a bachelor's degree. I'm gonna have to take
                      more years of other stuff. I'm thinking of taking
                      English literature and then, eventually becoming a
                      teacher, teaching in high school. But there's a
                      long way to go, so I'll probably not be done until
                      I'm like 28, 29 and I'm 23 right now. I'm not
                      really worrying about jobs yet. ", "userDefined": false } ], "isTemplate": false, "count": 0 },]
