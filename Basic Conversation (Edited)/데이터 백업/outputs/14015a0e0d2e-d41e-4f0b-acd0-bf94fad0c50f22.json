It's the big one. It's the one of the future and that's MOOCs. So MOOCs stands for Massive Open Online Course and that (module) shows you how to make a full course based on video, so first you can make videos using Screencast-O-Matic or Screenflow or Camtasia, and then once you have the videos you can create your own lessons online using Teachable or Udemy.
