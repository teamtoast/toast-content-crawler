I wasn't able to fall asleep, but you know I found out that tea actually has caffeine in it, so it has the same effect, so I guess it really depends on the day. If I'm really sleepy and I need to wake up in the morning, I prefer coffee but if it's just to relax at night, I would rather have a cup of tea.", "userDefined": false } ], "isTemplate": false, "count": 0 },]
