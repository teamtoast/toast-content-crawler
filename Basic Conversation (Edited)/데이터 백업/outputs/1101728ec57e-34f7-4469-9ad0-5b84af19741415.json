A project I recently worked on was on a shopping center in Auckland. It's quite a big shopping center in the east of Auckland, and there is not good public transport around. So, there are not that many buses, there's no train station there, a lot of car parking. So, the owners of the shopping center wanted to influence people and make them catch the bus, the little that was available. So, they hired our consultancy, and I worked on some of the reports for them. And we basically looked at simple things that we could do to promote walking and cycling, first off, and then buses." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
