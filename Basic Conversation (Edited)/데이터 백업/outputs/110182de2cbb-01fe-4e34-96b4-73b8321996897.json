You can't receive a marriage licence if you're a gay couple. That being said, my town especially, Santa Fe, is a haven for lesbian couples. We have very many lesbians in my town. Generally we get along pretty well. Although my state is a very conservative Republican state, I live in kind of an enclave of liberalism and I have issues with it and I think that this is pretty standard for most Republicans. I have religious issues with it and moral issues with gay marriage. I personally don't think it's right. I think that marriage between a man and a woman is something that's more than just a legal contract but it's an important moral connection that you have and I think that it should still be illegal to marry another man or another woman." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
