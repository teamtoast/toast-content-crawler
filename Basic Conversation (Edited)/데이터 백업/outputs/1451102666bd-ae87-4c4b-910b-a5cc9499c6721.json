                      and I see it in clinical practice to be true. You
                      don't really need to be Ph.D in healing or
                      nutrition. If you throw into your diet variety,
                      and it would change with the season, it would
                      change with location, it would change with your
                      mood and how your body feels, then that's it. A
                      variety can really give your body everything, and
                      your body has all the knowledge, all the wisdom,
                      and knows what to do with that. " } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
