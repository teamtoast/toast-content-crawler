That means you sign a contract when you go to the school, saying that for girls for example, you won't show too much of your shoulders, or you won't like skirts that are like too short, and for guys you can't have like pants with a hole where you can see stuff. You really need to dress like properly, and actually if you don't you receive like some sanction. You need to go home and change yourself, and it's written in your file. That's really about high school, so I don't know about Denmark." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
