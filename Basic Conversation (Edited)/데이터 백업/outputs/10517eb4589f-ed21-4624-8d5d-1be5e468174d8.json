Well, I think I 'd rather be a famous singer. I wish I was good at singing though, but that's what I need. I just all about spreading the love and sharing my thoughts with other people and just expressing my mind, and I think singers have the opportunity to share what's in their minds. Express themselves, share the love, you know, and I think that's what I'd much rather do, just spread the word. I'm all about words. I think words have a very, very big effect on people. Yeah, what you say really does matter, so being a singer you can actually say a lot and touch a lot people's hearts. That's my destiny in life. I want to touch many hearts. Yeah, so a singer for me." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
