For me it used to be the other way around. I was a coffee addict. I have to have my frappacino in the afternoon, my Americano in the morning and all these different types of coffee in the day, but then eventually I got the same problem. I wasn't able to fall asleep, but you know I found out that tea actually has caffeine in it, so it has the same effect, so I guess it really depends on the day. If I'm really sleepy and I need to wake up in the morning, I prefer coffee but if it's just to relax at night, I would rather have a cup of tea." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
