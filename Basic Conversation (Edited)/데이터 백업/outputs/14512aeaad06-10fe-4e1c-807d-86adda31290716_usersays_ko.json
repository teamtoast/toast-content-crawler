                      Oriental wisdom of yin and yang. If you can
                      visualize the symbol of yin-yang, usually it's two
                      half-circles, and there is a seed of the opposite
                      color right in the middle of it. So in the white
                      you would have a seed of black, and in the black a
                      seed of white, and they constantly turn into each
                      other. So too much of something turns into its
                      exact opposite. ", "userDefined": false } ], "isTemplate": false, "count": 0 },]
