I didn't have to wake up early every morning. If I did, I could get my work done early. The amount of work that I had, the time I spent doing it was dependent upon me and my schedule and how much time I wanted to work. I had almost the same amount of work as all of my other friends in real schools but the difference was I didn't have scheduled breaks or lunches or anything so if I sat down for four hours and I just wanted to work straight, then I could finish a whole day's worth of work in four hours. That's a good thing about it, I was able to travel and some days I wouldn't even do any school work because I'd be busy doing other things but that meant that I would have to do two days some other time. One of the bad things was that I didn't get to meet quite as many new people. I didn't have the typical high school experience which I feel shapes a lot of who people are. I wasn't able to meet friends in that sense, in the high school sense. I still have great friends and I'm not a loner ", "userDefined": false } ], "isTemplate": false, "count": 0 },]
