Maybe as a woman I see it differently so I kind of support feminism rather largely. So I kind of feel like a woman has the right to choose what she wants to do with her body and you mentioned that a woman has to live or somebody has to live with their choice but the man doesn't have to live with his choice because he doesn't have to go through nine months of pregnancy and then eighteen years of raising a child because at least in poor communities the father is more likely to leave and so then the woman has to deal with that. And with that being said, I did grow up in a Catholic household and I went to an all girls Catholic high school and I think over the years I"ve become more conservative on the issue and I don't like the idea of abortion and I kind of disagree with it in some respects but I do understand that people have the right to do what they want with their own body and many Democrats feel that, you know, a woman should be able to have her own bodily rights, and also that also especially as far as health care is concerned that abortion should be included in health care and you know, be considered a normal medical practice.
