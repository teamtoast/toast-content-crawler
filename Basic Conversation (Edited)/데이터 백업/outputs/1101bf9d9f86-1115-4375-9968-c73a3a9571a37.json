I was home schooled for six years actually, my whole high school experience. It was good but it was bad. There are things that I liked and there are things that I didn't like. For instance, I didn't have quite as many friends as I could have. The reason I was home schooled was because I was always traveling with my family and I wasn't able to stay at home and go to school five days a week. But the classes were good. I had almost the same classes as everybody else did. I learned the same things, I just learned them in a different environment by myself." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
