Honestly, I wouldn't do that either. I mean it's just a little statue and it's just come and take a picture but it's not really anything to do with Denmark. I would try and go to Copenhagen in the city like the old time maybe Christiantown and try to find a small coffee shop and maybe go to just a bar and listen to some music and just find some good food . Yup, that's what I would do but of course, go see the little mermaid. At least you can check it off your bucketlist.
