                      I still have so many years left. The degree that
                      I'm taking, social anthropology, isn't really a
                      degree that you get work from. Especially, only
                      with a bachelor's degree. I'm gonna have to take
                      more years of other stuff. I'm thinking of taking
                      English literature and then, eventually becoming a
                      teacher, teaching in high school. But there's a
                      long way to go, so I'll probably not be done until
                      I'm like 28, 29 and I'm 23 right now. I'm not
                      really worrying about jobs yet. " } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
