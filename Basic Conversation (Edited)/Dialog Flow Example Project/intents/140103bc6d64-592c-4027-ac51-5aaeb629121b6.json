Yeah, actually, I think our country has a touristic place but I think that if you don't want to go to Paris and want to see another part of France, I would advice you to go to Brittany. It's the north of France and it's close to the sea and it's really pretty because it's less touristic but there's like amazing sightseeing and the sea. It's quite cold because we share it with Britain, but like really amazing places to see. And me, if I go to Denmark, I think I would totally go and take a picture where there is a little mermaid." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
