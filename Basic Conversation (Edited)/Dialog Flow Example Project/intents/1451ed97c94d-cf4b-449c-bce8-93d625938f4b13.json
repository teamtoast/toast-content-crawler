                      for a lot of things in the healing world. It's
                      much, much easier to prevent disease than to
                      reverse it. So a lot of times if you get the
                      disease, the best-case scenario in modern medicine
                      is just to control the symptoms and to slow down
                      the progression. But if you use the natural
                      preventive medicine, it's actually much less
                      effort, and you can enjoy life and you can enjoy
                      that first stitch without ever thinking or needing
                      the nine that would be needed if you didn't do
                      something preventive. " } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
