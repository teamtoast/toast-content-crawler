                      if you haven't worn something for six months, you

                      not logical, given that there are four seasons and
                      they last a year. If you haven't worn something
                      for a year, maybe you should consider throwing it
                      out. But yeah, definitely, at the start of the
                      season, not in the opposite season. You have to
                      think about the weather. ", "userDefined": false } ], "isTemplate": false, "count": 0 },]
