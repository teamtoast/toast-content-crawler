We have holidays for the Malays and Indians, and there's three groups, they make up like probably almost the biggest percentage in Singapore, and so for example a Chinese holiday would be Chinese New Year of course. That's the main one, and for Indians there is a holiday called Depavali and that is nice as well. Lots of lights and for Malay they have holidays also.
