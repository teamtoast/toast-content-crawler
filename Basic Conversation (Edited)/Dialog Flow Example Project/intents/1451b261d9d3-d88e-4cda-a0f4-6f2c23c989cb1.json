We are very busy now because we have to study for exams so I'm making something very quick. It's just some meat with salad and potatoes that are even not peeled if you look at it.

I kind of like this food, it's enough for a day." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
