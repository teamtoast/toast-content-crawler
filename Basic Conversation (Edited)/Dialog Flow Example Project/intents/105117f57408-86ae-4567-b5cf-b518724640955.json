We don't have any government supported childcare.

They don't have education. They don't have job opportunities, and so it's really kind of hard for them to get out, and they feel almost hopeless." } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
