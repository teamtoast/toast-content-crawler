When you tried that and you did not receive what you're entitled to, then you go outside of your national system and try to find another way to get justice which would be contacting for example an NGO like this one and try to bring this case into the Inter-American Commission.", "userDefined": false } ], "isTemplate": false, "count": 0 },]
