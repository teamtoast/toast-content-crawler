                      what you were talking about. After high school, I
                      went to Barcelona to study graphic design and I
                      was supposed to be there for four years, but it
                      was very scary and I was only 19 years old living
                      in a foreign country. The university wasn't really
                      good. They promised us an English class, but they
                      didn't speak English so we were the only four
                      people in the English class and they were only
                      speaking Spanish to us. We couldn't understand
                      anything, so it was a very stressful situation;
                      being in a new country, not speaking the language,
                      and the university not being very supportive. That
                      was very stressful, but it was a very good
                      experience and I learned a lot from it, but I
                      ended up going back to Norway and going to
                      university there instead. Yeah. " } ], "defaultResponsePlatforms": {}, "speech": [] } ], "priority": 500000, "webhookUsed": false, "webhookForSlotFilling": false, "fallbackIntent": false, "events": [] }
