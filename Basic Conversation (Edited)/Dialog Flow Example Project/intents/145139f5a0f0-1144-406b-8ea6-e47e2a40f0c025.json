                      you write, unlike speaking or talking to somebody,
                      it gives you time to really think about what you
                      want to do, what you want to write, and you can
                      focus on grammar more. That helps to actually talk
                      to somebody maybe a day, right, next day, or you
                      have to write something else in the class, that
                      would help you. So keeping the journal will help
