And with that being said, I did grow up in a Catholic household and I went to an all girls Catholic high school and I think over the years I\"ve become more conservative on the issue and I don't like the idea of abortion and I kind of disagree with it in some respects but I do understand that people have the right to do what they want with their own body and many Democrats feel that, you know, a woman should be able to have her own bodily rights, and also that also especially as far as health care is concerned that abortion should be included in health care and you know, be considered a normal medical practice. \n",

Yeah, it's, actually for a dry country it's interesting that it has so many water sports, people that really love water sports too especially on the eastern side of the country because it's tropical warm climate year round. The sea temperature is quite warm and at the same time it has a lot of really big waves so I think two of the world's biggest surfing events are held in South Africa yearly. The one is near Jeffreys Bay and the other one is near Durban and that's where all the world's surf champions come to surf and test their skills. But if you're not into surfing you can go wind surfing which actually on the eastern coast is really famous because of the strong winds over there and the relatively, not calm seas, but actually there's a lot of open plains to do wind surfing on so it's really famous for that. And then like skiing and water skiing of course really famous too. People really enjoy the water sports.\n",
