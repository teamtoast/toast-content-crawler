      "질문: Hello.  My name is Aiste and I'm from Lithuania.  It's for elllo.org.  And now I want to talk about my favorite place in the city.  My favorite place in the city is the park.  I really like parks because parks are green.  Parks like nature inside of a big, big place.  In the park you can hide away from the smell of the cars and the noise from the fabrics and always when I'm in the city I always stop in the park for lunch.  I prefer much more buying some lunchboxes from the market and coming to eat in the park rather than sitting in cafe and being in one more building again.\n",
